    Metadata is usually specific to a given microbiome study,
        and collecting sample metadata is typically one of the first steps you’ll take before beginning a QIIME 2 analysis. 
        It is up to the investigator to decide what information is collected and tracked as metadata. 
        QIIME 2 does not place restrictions on what types of metadata are expected to be present; 
        there are no enforced “metadata standards”. This is your opportunity to track whatever information 
        you think may be important to your analyses, and unfortunately QIIME 2 is not able to gather 
        that information for you. When in doubt, collect as much metadata as possible, 
        as you may not be able to retroactively collect certain types of information

    Metadata Validation
        Leading and trailing whitespace characters
            If any cell in the metadata contains leading or trailing whitespace characters (e.g. spaces, tabs), 
                those characters will be ignored when the file is loaded. 
                Thus, leading and trailing whitespace characters are not significant, 
                so cells containing the values 'gut' and '  gut  ' are equivalent. This rule is applied before any other rules described below.

    Comments and Empty Rows
        Rows whose first cell begins with the pound sign (#) are interpreted as comments and may appear anywhere in the file. 
            Comment rows are ignored by QIIME 2 and are for informational purposes only. Inline comments are not supported.
            Empty rows (e.g. blank lines or rows consisting solely of empty cells) may appear anywhere in the file and are ignored.

    Identifier Column
        The first column in the metadata file is the identifier (ID) column. 
            This column defines the sample or feature IDs associated with your study. 
            It is not recommended to mix sample and feature IDs in a single metadata file; 
            keep sample and feature metadata stored in separate files.

    The ID column name (i.e. ID header) must be one of the following values. 
    The values listed below may not be used to name other IDs or columns in the file.
        Case-insensitive:
            ・id
            ・sampleid
            ・sample id
            ・sample-id
            ・featureid
            ・feature i
            ・feature-id
    Case-sensitive (these are mostly for backwards-compatibility with QIIME 1, biom-format, and Qiita files):
            #SampleID
            #Sample ID
            #OTUID
            #OTU ID
            sample_name

    The following rules apply to IDs: [Sampleを区別するIDの設定方法,ルール]
        1. IDs may consist of any Unicode characters, with the exception that IDs must not start with the pound sign (#), 
            as those rows would be interpreted as comments and ignored. 
            See the section Recommendations for Identifiers for recommendations on choosing identifiers in your study.
        2.IDs cannot be empty (i.e. they must consist of at least one character).
        3.IDs must be unique (exact string matching is performed to detect duplicates).
        4.At least one ID must be present in the file.
        5.IDs cannot use any of the reserved ID column names listed above.
        6.Identifiers should be 36 characters long or less.
        👊.Identifiers should contain only ASCII alphanumeric characters (i.e. in the range of [a-z], [A-Z], or [0-9]), 
            the period (.) character, or the dash (-) character.

        An important point to remember is that sometimes values in your sample metadata can become identifiers. 
            For example, taxonomy annotations can become feature identifiers following qiime taxa collapse, 
            and sample or feature metadata values can become identifiers after applying qiime feature-table group. 
            If you plan to apply these or similar methods where metadata values can become identifiers, 
            you will be less likely to encounter problems if the values adhere to these identifier recommendations as well.

    Note [metadataとなる.tsvは下流の解析において解析結果を格納する際に, 識別子として働くため, 厳密な作成ルールが存在する(使用するsoftwareで異なる)]
    Some bioinformatics tools may have more restrictive requirements on identifiers than the recommendations that are outlined here. 
        For example, Illumina sample sheet identifiers cannot have . characters, 
        while we do include those in our set of recommended characters. Similarly, 
        Phylip requires that identifiers are a maximum of 10 characters, while we recommend length 36 or less. 
        If you plan to export your data for use with other tools that may have more restrictive requirements on identifiers, 
        we recommend that you adhere to those requirements in your QIIME 2 analyses as well, to simplify subsequent processing steps.

    Metadata Columns
        The ID column is the first column in the metadata file, and can optionally be followed by additional columns defining metadata associated 
        with each sample or feature ID. Metadata files are not required to have additional metadata columns, so a file containing only an ID column is a valid QIIME 2 metadata file.
    
    The following rules apply to column names:[カラム名のルール]
        1.May consist of any Unicode characters.
        2.Cannot be empty (i.e. column names must consist of at least one character).
        3.Must be unique (exact string matching is performed to detect duplicates).
        4.Column names cannot use any of the reserved ID column names described in the section Identifier Column.
    The following rules apply to column values:[カラム要素のルール]
        1.May consist of any Unicode characters.
        2.Empty cells represent missing data. Other values such as NA are not interpreted as missing data; 
            only the empty cell is recognized as “missing”. Note that cells consisting solely of whitespace characters 
            are also interpreted as missing data because leading and trailing whitespace characters are always ignored, effectively making the cell empty.
    
    Column Types









⭐️illumina fastq
What does a FASTQ file look like?
For each cluster that passes filter, a single sequence is written to the corresponding sample’s R1 FASTQ file, 
    and, for a paired-end run, a single sequence is also written to the sample’s R2 FASTQ file. Each entry in a FASTQ files consists of 4 lines:
1.A sequence identifier with information about the sequencing run and the cluster. 
    The exact contents of this line vary by based on the BCL to FASTQ conversion software used.
2.The sequence (the base calls; A, C, T, G and N).
3.A separator, which is simply a plus (+) sign.
4.The base call quality scores. These are Phred +33 encoded, using ASCII characters to represent the numerical quality scores.

FastQ Files
BaseSpace Sequence Hub converts *.bcl files into FASTQ files, 
    which contain base call and quality information for all reads that pass filtering.
BaseSpace Sequence Hub automatically generates FASTQ files in sample sheet-driven workflow apps. 
    Other apps that perform alignment and variant calling also automatically use FASTQ files.
FASTQ files can be used as sequence input for alignment and other secondary analysis software. 
    Do not use them with tools that are not compatible with the FASTQ format.

How to view a FASTQ file
FASTQ files can contain up to millions of entries and can be several megabytes or gigabytes in size, 
    which often makes them too large to open in a normal text editor. 
    Generally, it is not necessary to view FASTQ files, because they are intermediate output files used as input for tools 
    that perform downstream analysis, such as alignment to a reference or de novo assembly

Q Score Definition [Phred +33 encoded]
The sequencing quality score of a given base, Q, is defined by the following equation:
    Q = -10log10(e)
where e is the estimated probability of the base call being wrong.

Higher Q scores indicate a smaller probability of error.
Lower Q scores can result in a significant portion of the reads being unusable. 
They may also lead to increased false-positive variant calls, resulting in inaccurate conclusions.
A quality score of 20 (Q20) represents an error rate of 1 in 100 
(meaning every 100 bp sequencing read may contain an error), with a corresponding call accuracy of 99%. 

When sequencing quality reaches Q30, virtually all of the reads will be perfect, 
with no errors or ambiguities. This is why Q30 is considered a benchmark for quality in next-generation sequencing (NGS).
